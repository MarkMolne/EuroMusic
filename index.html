            <h2 id="sub1">A recap about ESC's history</h2>
            <p id="intro">The Eurovision Song Contest was created as an idea to promote cooperation between European countries through music after the Second World War.</p> 
            <p id="intro">In April 1956 the first ever ESC was held in Lugano, Switzerland with 7 countries participating. The winner was also the host country represented by Lys Assia with the song <i>Refrain</i> The other contestants were Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, France, Louxemboug and Italy . </p>
            <p id="intro">Since then, 64 Contests have taken place in all over Europe in cities like Madrid, Brighton, Tel Aviv, Lisbon or Viena following the tradition that the country that wins it organises the following year's contest. Only a couple times that rule couldn't be followed due to economical reasons.</p>
            <p id="intro">Until 2020 every year we have had a Grand Finale precided by two semifinals, that were incorporated in the 2000s due to the amount of countries particicipating, but the show was cancelled due to COVID-19 and an Eurovision Special called Europe: Shine a Light toke place in the Grand Finale night.
