            <p>DING DANG DONG! London Calling! Last night aired a brand new episode of BBC Three's Rupaul's Drag Race UK Season 2. After a 7 month break due the Covid-19 the Queens reuninted back in the WorkRoom with te re-incorporation of Joe Black, the first eliminated Queen.</p>
            <p>But the biggest surprise when was RuPaul anounced the thematic the Main Challenge: The RuRusivison. You've heard correct, they served what we all wanted: the Mashup of RPDR and the ESC.</p>
            <p> Two teams where formed, but only one stole the show. The United Kingdolls, formed by the queens Awhora, Lawrence Cheney, Tayce and Bimini Bon Boulash, performed their version of U.K. Hun? which is number 1 on ITunes since this morning. Of course they won the Challenge and the iconic RuRuPeter Badge.</p>
            <p>The fans where shocked and instatly started claiming to the new girl band to represent the UK in the following ESC. They followed the trajectory that the Frock Destroyers got last year.</p>
            <p>We have made a desicion, we want the United Kingdolls on the ESC2022. Shantay you Stay!</p>
